THIS IS A QUICK WGET ALTERNATIVE MODIFIED FROM AN EXAMPLE BY GUIDO VAN ROSSUM

THE PROGRESS MONITOR [PROG.PY] IS BASED OFF AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE IN THE PYTHON COOKBOOK FROM O'REILLY 

EVERYTHING WORKS OFF STANDARD PYTHON MODULES INCLUDING URLLIB

WGET.PY AND PROG.PY SHOULD BE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY OR MAKE SURE YOU PUT PROG.PY IN YOUR PYTHON PATH

TO INVOKE:

	SINGLE FILE DOWNLOADING

	$ ./wget.py http://example.com/myfile.tgz

	MULTIPLE FILE DOWNLOADING

	$ ./wget.py http://example.com/a.tgz http://example2.com/b.zip http://example.com/c.tgz

FILES WILL BE DOWNLOADED TO THE CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY


CHANGES:

	0.2 -
		FILES WILL NOT BE OVERWRITTEN IF EXIST (ADDS A UNIX TIMESTAMP TO NAME IF ALREADY EXISTS)
